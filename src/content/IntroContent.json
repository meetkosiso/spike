  "text": "I was recently immortalized on the Ethereum blockchain in the official Spike token! Community members have been working tirelessly to get my name out there – and I’m flattered. I know the rest of my brothers are here too, so I’m glad to be included. I hear they even made my token address start with 0x1984. Talk about attention to detail – 1984 was when I was born! You see, I’m sort of like the OG of OGs, the meme of memes. You may be familiar with my good friend and creator, Matt Furie – Well, when he was just a little guy, he brought me to life! He really is a talented artist.",
